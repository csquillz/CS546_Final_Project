#Budget Tracker
# CS546_Final_Project


## Summary

**Budget Tracker** is a practical budget and goal tracking app used for money management. It offers different visual tools that can help users understand where they are spending most of their money, where they should be saving and where they can be spending more money. It will allow users to input customized goals for certain spending limitations in specific spending categories. Once users input their receipt information, this data will be paralled with their inputted goals to return their spending habits results. With this Bugdet Tracking tool, users can create budgets, set spending goals, and store information about purchases.

## How To Run


There are few simple steps in running our program. You first need to make sure that when you are in the appropriate directory you be sure to install the correct packages to run this program. This can be done by typing "npm install" in the command terminal and pressing enter. Following this step, you can initiate the run process by typing "npm start" in the command prompt. If these two steps are done successfully, you will receive a message looking something similar to this:

"Your server is now listening on port ####! Navigate to http://localhost:#### to access it"

Once you navigate to your local host you will be presented with this start up screen:

The interactive dashboard features graphs, which segment the userâ€™s expenditures into categories, and auto-updating widgets, which illustrate spending metrics and statistics. The user enters budgets for categories along with a date range that is used to display spending stats over that particular time period.

The bar graph and the donut chart show stats based on the user's spending habits within the last 30 days. The bar graph shows the average amount spent per category, while the donut chart displays the total amount spent.

The Budget Remaining widget's progress bars graphically represent the remaining money in the user's budget. Two more widgets display the average and total amounts spent per category within the specified date range. Everything on the dashboard updates in real time as the user adds a new budget or a new expenditure.

Spent's dynamic package tracking feature monitors online purchases, which displays the last place a package was scanned, its delivery status, and plots its current location on a map. When the user saves a new purchase, they are given the option to input tracking information. If the user has tracking information saved, a paper airplane icon is displayed next to the corresponding purchase, and the user simply has to click on the icon to track their package.

Spent is a one-page dashboard. There is beauty and functionality in simplicity, and the user's flow is kept direct and clean. The user inputs budget and expenditure information in modal window forms that do not take them away from the main dashboard, keeping the user experience focused.
